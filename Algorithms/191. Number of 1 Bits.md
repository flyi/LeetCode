[191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)
=======================
>Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).
>
>For example, the 32-bit integer '11' has binary representation `00000000000000000000000000001011`, so the function should return 3.

----------
## My solutions:
### With C++:

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int j=0,k=0;
        for(int i=0;i<32;i++)
        {
            uint32_t m =1<<i;
            k= (m&n)>>i;
            j=j+k;
        }
        return j;
    }
};
```
