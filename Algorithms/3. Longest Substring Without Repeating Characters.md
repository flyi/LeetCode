[3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
===================================================
>Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
>
>Examples:
>
>Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
>
>Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.
>
>Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.

## My solutions:
###With C++:

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        string sub = "";
        int max = 0,j = 0,start = 0,i = 0;
        int n = s.length();
        for(i;i < n + 1;i++)
        {
            if(max < i - start) {
                max = i - start;}
            j = sub.find(s[i]);
            start = start + j + 1;
            sub = s.substr(start,i - start + 1);
        }
        return max;
    }
};
```
