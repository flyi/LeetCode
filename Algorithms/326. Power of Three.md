[326. Power of Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-three/)
=====================
>Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.
>
><strong>Follow up:</strong>

>Could you do it without using any loop / recursion? 

## My solutions:
###With C++:

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        int maxPower = pow(3,(int)(log(0x7fffffff)/log(3)));
        if(n<=0)return false;
        else return(!(maxPower % n));
    }
};
```

NOTE(2016/5/30):

`pow(3,(int)(log(0x7fffffff)/log(3)))` is to calculate the max power of 3 in the range of INT, and it's a constant 1162261467.So my code can be in one line:

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return(n>0 && !(1162261467 % n));
    }
};
```
