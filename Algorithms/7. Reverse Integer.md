[7. Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)
====================
>Reverse digits of an integer.
>
>Example1: x = 123, return 321
>
>Example2: x = -123, return -321 

## My solutions:
###With C++:

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
        int remain = x, reverse_x = 0;
        while(remain)
        {
            reverse_x = (reverse_x + remain % 10 / 10.0) * 10;
            remain = remain / 10;
        }
        if(reverse_x == INT_MIN)return 0;
        else return reverse_x;
    }
};
```

NOTE(2016/5/29):

When the reversed integer overflowsï¼Œit turns to constant -2147483648(Minimum number of 32-bit binaries).In C++,the constant has been defined as INT_MIN.
