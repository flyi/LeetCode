[9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)
======================
>Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
>
><strong>Some hints:</strong>
>
>Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
>
>If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
>
>You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
>
>There is a more generic way of solving this problem.

## My solutions:
### With C++:

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        stringstream stream;
        string str_x;
        stream << x;
        stream >> str_x;
        int n = str_x.length();
        for(int i = 0; i < (n+1)/2 ; i++)
        {
            if(str_x[i] != str_x[n-1-i])
            return 0;
        }
        return 1;
    }
};
```

### With Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if(x < 0):
            return False
        elif(x < 10):
            return True
        number_list = [x%10]
        remain = x//10
        while(remain):
            number_list.append(remain%10)
            remain = remain//10
        return number_list == number_list[::-1]
```
